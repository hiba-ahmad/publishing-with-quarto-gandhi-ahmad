# What is Quarto?

## **Hello Quarto!**

<br>

QuartoÂ® is an open-source, scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

<br>

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
It allows a user to:
:::

::: incremental
-   Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable, [as well as computing languages that don't even exist at the moment]{style="color:teal"}.

-   Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.

-   Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

-   The [goal of Quarto]{style="color:teal"} is to make the process of creating and collaborating dramatically better by unifying and extending the RMarkdown ecosystem!
:::

## The Big Picture!

<br>

Quarto and R Markdown share the same core team of developers - [Carlos Scheidegger, Charles Teague, Christophe Dervirvieux, J.J. Allaire, Yihui Xie]{style="color:teal"}

## Quarto \>\>\> R Markdown

<br>

-   Quarto and its enhancements are inbuilt with RStudio; no download necessary

-   Quarto allows [unified syntax]{style="color:teal"} regardless of [input format, engine and language]{style="color:teal"}

-   40 different outputs available

-   Better accessibility and richer features

-   Quarto doesn't rely on mandatory R run time

<br>

-   [That said, if you heavily use access tools built around R Markdown such as blogdown, xaringan, workflowr and papaja, R Markdown might be better suited for you!]{style="color:teal"}

# Publishing with Quarto

## Publishing with Quarto

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-maroon}
Author \> Render \> Publish
:::
:::

-   Quarto uses an engine like knitr to [execute code]{style="color:teal"} and [generate a temporary output(.md).]{style="color:teal"}. The .md file is [processed via Pandoc & Quarto's Lua filters]{style="color:teal"} to convert to a [final output]{style="color:teal"}.

-   Multiple ways to publish documents, presentations, websites and more created using Quarto.

-   Output in standard formats such as HTML, PDF, MS Word etc. ensures that it can be published anywhere.

-   Quarto publish command publishes easily to various services such as GitHub, Netlify, RStudio Connect, etc.

-   Various other tools to publish from a Continuous Integration (CI) system.

# Authoring

## Authoring Quarto Documents

### *Elements of Markdown*

<br>

Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read.

**Text Formatting**

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
## Markdown allows you to format text as **bold** or *italics*. You can 
## also add superscripts^2^ or subscripts~2~, 
## and display code `verbatim`.

## You can also ~~strikethrough~~ text or present it in [caps]{.smallcaps}.
```

Markdown allows you to format text as **bold** or *italics*. You can also add superscripts^2^ or subscripts~2~, and display code `verbatim`.

You can also ~~strikethrough~~ text or present it in [caps]{.smallcaps}.

## Authoring Quarto Documents

**Math**

<br>

Formulas in Quarto can be written using '\$'.

<br>

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
## The area of circle is $A = \pi r^2$
## Basic algebra formula: $a^2- b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$

```

<br>

The area of circle is $A = \pi r^2$

Basic algebra formula: $a^2- b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$

## Authoring Quarto Documents

**Links and Images**

<br>

You can embed [links with names](https://quarto.org/) or direct urls like <https://quarto.org/>.

For images, the syntax is as follows:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
## You can embed [links with names](https://quarto.org/) or
## direct urls like <https://quarto.org/>.

## For images, the syntax is ![Linking Images](IDS07.jpg){width="75%"}
```
