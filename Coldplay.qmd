## *History*

### *Formation Years*

[Chris Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin) and [Jonny Buckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Buckland) first met each other during their orientation week at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London) in September 1996.[^2] The pair spent the rest of the year planning a band, which led to the formation of Pectoralz. They began to write their first songs together in 1997 and practised every night. That same year, Martin met [Tim Rice-Oxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice-Oxley), who was invited to be Coldplay's keyboard player but declined, since [Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keane_(band)) was already active.

The meeting was ultimately responsible for shaping both bands as quartets. During the following months, [Guy Berryman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Berryman) joined the group and their name was changed to Big Fat Noises. [Will Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Champion) would then complete the line-up in 1998, when the band renamed themselves Starfish "in a panic" after he scheduled their debut live performance at The Laurel Tree only a few days after becoming a member.

## *Artistry*

### *Creative Process*

-   Bassist [Guy Berryman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Berryman) once explained that the band often have a title and concept in mind before the music arrives, which serves to provide a "framework into which we can work thematically". During an interview for YouTube in 2019, lead vocalist [Chris Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin) described their way of making songs as "a series of doors" where he usually brings initial ideas to guitarist [Jonny Buckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Buckland), who either disapproves or gives his input on them. The same happens from [Buckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Buckland) to [Berryman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Berryman) and then drummer [Will Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Champion), allowing each band member to express themselves artistically.

-   This process, however, is known to not always be linear, given how tracks like ["Magic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(Coldplay_song)) and ["Adventure of a Lifetime"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_of_a_Lifetime) started through the bass and guitar riffs from Berryman and Buckland respectively. When asked about avoiding the use of explicit language in the lyrics, Champion mentioned "sometimes there are more elegant ways of saying something", and "swear words are extremely useful at times", but "if you overuse them it lessens their impact".

1.  Coldplay are considered polarizing pop/rock icons,[^3] having received both praise and criticism from music reviewers as well as the public. They maintain a close relationship with fans through videos, letters and social media interactions, becoming the third and sixth most followed band in the world on Twitter and Instagram, respectively. They are also known to tease upoming releases by spreading easter eggs and clues around the world.

2.  On a survey published by the [Daily Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror) listing the most popular and unpopular artists in the United Kingdom, Coldplay were among the ~20~ most voted acts on both lists, the only other bands with the same distinction were [ABBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA) and [U2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2). In July 2000, [Alan McGee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_McGee) described their songs as "bedwetters music", a comment he later apologized for in 2020, adding that "I don't like their music but I don't think they are that bad". Buckland responded at the time saying "We are trying to be who we are, you know. Pretending to be 'a bit mad' would just be sad".

## *Legacy*

Coldplay is considered the most successful band of the 21st century. With over \~100 million albums sold globally, they are one of the best-selling artists of all time. [Parachutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachutes_(Coldplay_album)) (2000), [A Rush of Blood to the Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rush_of_Blood_to_the_Head) (2002) and X&Y (2005) have all been listed among the 50 best-selling albums of United Kingdom's history, marking the most appearances by a group in the ranking.[^4]

The latter was the third-fastest-selling record ever in the country upon release. In 2008, ["Viva la Vida"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_la_Vida) became the first song by a British group to top both UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100 since ["Wannabe"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannabe) by the [Spice Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls) in 1997. The track was praised as one of the best songs of the decade by Rolling Stone and BBC America as well.
